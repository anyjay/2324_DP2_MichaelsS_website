        <b>Structure:</b> The structure of blueberries is small and round, with a smooth, deep blue skin that is both attractive and appetizing. They are easy to eat by the handful and make a convenient, mess-free snack. However, their size can be a disadvantage when they roll off the table or out of your hand.

        <b>Structure:</b> The structure of blackberries is unique, composed of numerous tiny drupelets that give them a slightly bumpy texture. Their deep, dark purple color is visually striking.
